MODEL CHECKPOINT INSTRUCTIONS
============================================================

To run the inference script (predict.py), you must place the 
trained model weights and the data in the right folder.

1. DOWNLOAD WEIGHTS
-------------------
Download the 'best_model.pth' from the following Drive link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Iz_t2ZtWe19txEgT9baiXfhMzfTu8iqg

2. FILE PLACEMENT
-----------------
Ensure the file is named exactly 'best_model.pth' and is 
located at: ./checkpoints/best_model.pth

3. RUN PREDICTION
-----------------
The predict.py script is pre-configured to look for the weights 
in this directory by default.
