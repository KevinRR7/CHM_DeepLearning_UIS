TEST IMAGES & INFERENCE GUIDE
============================================================

To see the model in action
Perform the following steps:

1. DOWNLOAD SAMPLE IMAGES and checkpoint
-------------------------
Due to storage limits on GitHub, the high-resolution test 
images and checkpoint are hosted on Google Drive. 

Download them here: link de drive

2. FOLDER SETUP
---------------
Place the downloaded images inside 
this directory: /test_images/

And place the checkpoint inside 
this directory: /checkpoints/

3. RUN INFERENCE
----------------
Use the provided 'predict.py' script in the /scripts/ folder 
to generate Canopy Height Model (CHM) predictions:

   python scripts/predict.py --image_path ./test_images/sample.jpg

4. EXPECTED OUTPUT
------------------
The script will process the RGB input and save a 
visualization in the /predictions/ folder showing:
- Original RGB Image
- Predicted CHM (with color scale in meters)

Note: Ensure you have the 'best_model.pth' file in your 
checkpoints directory before running the script.
